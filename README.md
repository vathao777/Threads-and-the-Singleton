Create a new Repository on your GitHub account with a README.md and a Java based .gitignore file
Clone the project into IntelliJ
Create a class, LazyInitializedSingleton, as shown in the link below (feel free to remove the package).

Now create a new thread using either the implements Runnable method, or the extend Thread method as indicated in the video.
Access your Singleton object from within your thread's run method and print out its hash-code similar to the SOUT hash-code example found at the link below.

Write a main method with a loop that uses your Runnable or Thread class to create at least 3 threads and start them!
In your README.md file, write what you observe after getting your code running.
Commit and Push your code back to your GitHub Account
Turn in your GitHub Account's URL for your created Repo to this Lab.
